                            At AmeriCare, we believe that care is more than a service; it&apos;s a heartfelt commitment to improving the lives of the elderly and medically fragile children.

                            Our founder, Calvin Wilkinson&apos;s, story is rooted in Atlanta, a city known for its vibrant communities and warm embrace. Raised in this nurturing environment, he learned early the power of healing and the significance of community.

                            Mr. Wilkinson&apos;s educational pursuits led him to the College of William and Mary, where he earned a degree in Biology. It was during this time that he recognized the transformative impact healthcare could have on individuals and families.
                            His journey continued at Mercer University, where he earned a Master&apos;s in Public Health. Along this path, Mr.Wilkinson encountered stories that would shape the very essence of AmeriCare.
